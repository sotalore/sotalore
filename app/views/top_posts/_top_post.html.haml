        The skills calculator now saves skill information for your avatars!

    %p
      Once you #{link_to_if(current_user.null?, 'register', new_user_registration_path)} for an account,
      you can #{link_to('create an Avatar', avatars_path)}. Then from the
      #{link_to('skills calculator', skills_path)}, select an Avatar from the
      top-right select box, and any skill levels you enter will be saved.

      I could still use lots of feedback on what to do next. I've made it
      possible to leave anonymous comments, so feel free to send me a message
      that way.
