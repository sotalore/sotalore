    %h3 What Skills Cost to Level

        %p
          Raising skill levels costs <em>Adventure</em> or <em>Crafting</em> Experience (XP).
          The amount of XP required is exponential in nature, causing higher-levels to cost
          considerably more than lower-levels.

        %p
          The chart below can help visualize the cost of raising skills. Change the
          <strong>Max Skill Level</strong> and <strong>Factor Cost</strong> to get
          an idea of the XP requirements to get a skill to a particular level.

        %p
          Along with the base XP cost, each skill also has a <strong>Factor Cost</strong>.
          This is a simple multiplier to the calculated XP cost.

        %p
          Most skills have a <strong>Factor Cost of 1</strong>. This commonly applies to active
          skills (e.g., red, yellow, or blue glyphs).

        %p
          Passive skills (i.e., grey glyphs) quite often have a <strong>Factor Cost of 4</strong>.

        %p
          Specializations and wardings (and a couple others) have a <strong>Factor Cost of 20</strong>.

        %p
          Check the <em>Adventure</em> and <em>Crafting</em> tabs above for the cost of
          each individual skill.

    %h3 Notes About Skill XP Math
    %p
      The calcuations used on this site differ from other tools I've seen. A lot of other tools use a
      "lookup" table to calculate the total amount of XP for a particular skill level between
      1 and 200. In my testing, some of these appeared to be inaccurate (although, still very useful,
      as the inaccuracies are relatively small).  So, instead, I've chosen to use a function to calculate
      required XP. I'm convinced this function is also slightly inaccurate, but close enough to be
      useful.

    %p
      That XP required function for a skill level is as follows (note that <em>**</em> is the power operator)...

    %pre.pb-4.text-xs.md:text-base
      XP = (xpFactorValue * (Math.ceil(((1.099711**(level-1)) - 1) * 100)))
