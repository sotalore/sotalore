            There are a lot of "items" that are not real, actual items.
            These items are referred to as <em>Abstract Items</em> (or <em>Abstractions</em>).
          %p
            These Abstract Items will often appear in a recipe, where
            any number of items (of all similar "type") can be used to
            execute the recipe.

          %p
            E.g., if you are asked for a "Metal Binding" you could use
            a "Iron Binding" or a "Copper Binding" (or many others).
            However, you will never find an actual item in the game named
            a "Metal Binding."

          %p
            Below are (most) all of the known Abstractions and corresponding
            items.
